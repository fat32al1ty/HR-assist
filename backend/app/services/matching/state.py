"""Data shapes carried through the matching pipeline.

Three records, kept tiny on purpose:

- ``ResumeContext`` is everything the matcher needs to know about the
  user's resume + preferences. Built once at the top of the pipeline
  and read-only after that — stages must not mutate it.
- ``Candidate`` is a single vacancy moving through the cascade.
  Mutable because later stages annotate it (``hybrid_score``, ``tier``,
  etc.) — but ``vacancy_id`` / ``payload`` / ``vector_score`` are
  invariant once the recall stage writes them.
- ``MatchingState`` bundles the active candidate list with the
  read-only context and a diagnostics counter. Each stage receives and
  returns one of these.

The point of naming these is that stages get a typed contract instead
of a dict-of-dicts. When Phase 2.4 adds ``role_family``, it is an
optional field here — no stage downstream has to know how it was
produced.
